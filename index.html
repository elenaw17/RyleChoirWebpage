        <h2 id="about">About Ryle Choirs</h2>
        <h3>Concert Choir</h3>
        <p>Concert Choir is for students who are beginning or intermediate singers. It is open to all grades and does not require an audition. Students will learn about vocal and choral techniques, music theory, musical language, sight reading, and different styles of singing. Over the course of the school year, there will be three concert choir performances. By the end of the school year, most students will be ready to progress to A Capella Choir if they wish to continue choir.</p>
        <h3>A Cappella Choir</h3>
        <p>The A Cappella Choir is designed for advanced choir students in grades 10-12. Students will perform music primarily a cappella, and they will frequently perform songs in foreign languages. They will further develop their musical skills, learning music at a fast pace. Choir students will have many formal and informal performances. They will participate in the same three concerts as the Concert Choir, and they will also have their own performances at school. They will have more opportunities to sing outside of school, and they will go to at least one major competition per year.</p>

        <h3>Dresses/Suits: $60</h3>
        <p>All choir students will be required to have a dress or suit for performances. Before the concert wear is made, students will take their measurements in order to ensure that the clothing fits them. If students have siblings or friends who are willing to give them their old performance wear, they may use that. The performance wear must be from Ryle Choirs.</p>
        <h3>Optional Events</h3>
        <p>In Ryle’s choir, students have the option to go to different choir related events, which include but are not limited to NKU Honor Choir, Louisville Honor Choir, Kentucky All-state Choir, and All-state Choir auditions. There are no buses to transport students to these events, but carpools can be arranged if necessary.</p>
        <h4>All State Choir</h4>
        <p>To participate in the Kentucky All State choir, students must first audition for a role (see All-state Choir Auditions). If students are accepted into All State, they will stay in hotel rooms when participating. </p>
        <h4>All State Choir Auditions</h4>
        <p>To audition for All State, students must learn their part of an SATB song and perform it in front of judges. Then students must individually sight read a short portion of unknown music. After completing auditions, students will be given a percentile of how well they performed. Only students of the highest percentiles will be admitted into All State. </p>

        <h4>NKU Honor Choir</h4>
        <p>To perform in the NKU Honor Choir, students must be selected by Mr. Hein to participate. A number of advanced students will be given the option to participate. Students will pay a $30 fee to participate, and will commute to practice.</p>
